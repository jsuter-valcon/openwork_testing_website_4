										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you noticed your mood changing as the nights start to draw in?</p>
<p>You’re not alone. In fact, <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/mental-illnesses-and-mental-health-problems/seasonal-affective-disorder-(sad)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers</a> believe that around 3% of people are affected by seasonal affective disorder (SAD), otherwise known as “winter depression”.</p>
<p>However, there are some simple steps you can take to reduce the impact the winter blues have on your life.</p>
<p>Read on to learn more about SAD, and how you can mitigate the effects this winter.</p>
<p><strong>What is SAD?</strong></p>
<p>Seasonal affective disorder has a lot in common with the symptoms of depression, but it only affects people during certain times of the year. Most commonly, SAD affects people during winter, but some people also experience it in the summer.</p>
<p>The symptoms of SAD can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Low mood</li>
<li>Low energy</li>
<li>Eating more</li>
<li>Sleeping more</li>
<li>Being less sociable</li>
<li>Lack of interest and enjoyment in life.</li>
</ul>
<p>SAD can affect anyone, but it is about three times more common in women than it is in men.</p>
<p>The symptoms tend to lessen on their own when the season ends and return annually. For example, someone who suffers from winter depression will start to feel better during spring.</p>
<p><strong>7 useful options that could help you treat SAD</strong></p>
<p>Living with SAD can be very difficult, but there are steps you can take to reduce the impact the symptoms have on your life.</p>
<p><em>1. Light therapy</em></p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers</a> aren’t sure what causes SAD, they have noted that the reduced amount of light in winter influences our appetite, wakefulness, and mood.</p>
<p>This is because light encourages your brain to reduce its production of melatonin (the hormone that makes you feel tired) and increase the production of serotonin (a hormone that affects your mood).</p>
<p>Light therapy involves sitting by a special lamp called a light box for 30 minutes every day to regulate these three factors.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to invest in a lightbox, you can also make the most of natural daylight by sitting next to a window or going for a walk.</p>
<p><em>2. Keep a journal</em></p>
<p>Making a note of your symptoms allows you to track them and notice patterns in your behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, a journal might help you discover what triggers your symptoms or track the things that boost your mood.</p>
<p>Writing down how you feel can also help you regulate your emotions and reduce anxiety, as well as break you out of any cycles of obsessive thoughts or brooding.</p>
<p><em>3. Plan ahead</em></p>
<p>If you know when your symptoms tend to start, it might be wise to plan.</p>
<p>For example, if you know that you will struggle to cook meals in the evening when it’s dark, you can prepare food in advance and store extra meals in the freezer for you to reheat when you need them.</p>
<p>You can also prepare by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning fun activities</li>
<li>Purchasing or putting up extra lighting</li>
<li>Rearranging any events you know will be stressful</li>
<li>Creating a self-care box to help you look after yourself</li>
<li>Ensuring you have time to rest and take part in your hobbies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing which symptoms affect you the most and coming up with strategies to cope with them in advance can reduce the effect SAD has on your day-to-day life.</p>
<p><em>4. Talk to your loved ones</em></p>
<p>Speaking to your friends, family members, and other important people in your life can help them understand what you’re going through so they can better support you during a difficult time.</p>
<p>You can also try joining a support group for other people who have SAD – either online or in person – so you can share your experiences with people who understand you.</p>
<p><em>5. Learn relaxation techniques</em></p>
<p>Learning to cope with the changes in emotions caused by SAD can reduce the impact they have on you.</p>
<p>Relaxation techniques that could help can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Being creative</li>
<li>Pilates or yoga</li>
<li>Listening to music</li>
<li>Breathing techniques</li>
<li>Spending time in nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a note of what lifts your mood and make sure you’re regularly taking part in these activities.</p>
<p><em>6. Look after your physical health</em></p>
<p>Eating and exercising can be more difficult while you’re experiencing SAD, but trying your best to keep your blood sugar up and move your body regularly can make a huge difference to your energy levels and mood.</p>
<p>Gentle exercise, such as swimming or going for a walk, can boost your mood and expose you to sunlight. And, if you can, eating healthier foods can help your body feel better.</p>
<p>It’s also important to take care of your personal hygiene. Small things, such as taking a shower, getting fully dressed even if you aren’t leaving the house, and brushing your teeth can make a big difference to your mood.</p>
<p><em>7. Speak to a therapist</em></p>
<p>SAD is as serious as other types of depression and can be treated in similar ways.</p>
<p>Speaking to a therapist or trying cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help ease your symptoms so you can continue living your life to the full.</p>
<p>Your doctor can also provide the help you need, by prescribing antidepressants or pointing you in the direction of a local support group, for example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were trying to improve your health and wellbeing, what would you think about changing?</p>
<p>Your first instinct may be to eat healthier foods or exercise more frequently. However, new research suggests that your social life might play a more important role in your overall health than you may think.</p>
<p>Read on to discover how loneliness could impact your health, and what you can do to combat it.</p>
<p><strong>What is loneliness?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/facts-and-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Campaign to End Loneliness</a> (CEL) defines loneliness as “a subjective, unwelcome feeling of lack or loss of companionship. It happens when there is a mismatch between the quantity and quality of the social relationships that we have, and those that we want.”</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that social isolation and loneliness are not the same thing. It’s common for people to feel lonely even when they are surrounded by friends or loved ones.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure whether loneliness affects you, you can take an online test to see how you rank on the <a href="https://psytests.org/ipl/uclaen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCLA loneliness scale</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How can loneliness affect your health?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/25/loneliness-can-increase-stroke-risk-by-up-to-56-finds-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The World Health Organization</a> (WHO) considers loneliness as one of the most significant global health concerns, as it can affect every aspect of your wellbeing.</p>
<p>People who suffer from chronic loneliness have a higher risk of developing certain mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression as well as dementia.</p>
<p>However, many people don’t know that loneliness can also have a huge impact on your physical health.</p>
<p>A recent study by Harvard University found that adults aged 50 and above who experienced chronic loneliness had a 56% higher risk of stroke than those who consistently reported not being lonely.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/health-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists</a> have linked chronic loneliness with an increased risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
<li>Susceptibility to viruses and respiratory illnesses</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the US surgeon general warned that the mortality effects of loneliness are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p>
<p><strong>How can you combat loneliness?</strong></p>
<p>Understandably, no one wants to feel lonely or suffer from a long list of negative side effects. However, learning to connect with new people and overcome anxiety surrounding social interactions can be very difficult for some people.</p>
<p>If you want to beat feelings of loneliness, try some of these methods to build stronger connections with the people around you.</p>
<p><em>1. Learn how to be comfortable with your own company</em></p>
<p>Self-esteem issues can often be a root cause of feelings of loneliness, so improving your relationship with yourself can help you to then connect with others.</p>
<p>You can learn to boost your self-esteem and become more comfortable with your own company by taking part in solo activities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going for a walk</li>
<li>Practising self-care</li>
<li>Starting a new hobby</li>
<li>Visiting a café or restaurant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoying fun things by yourself – especially ones that require social interactions – can help you boost your self-esteem and confidence so you can get out there and start talking to new people.</p>
<p><em>2. Open up to your loved ones</em></p>
<p>Loneliness can also be caused by a lack of deep connections with the people you know, or the feeling that those around you aren’t giving you the care or attention you need.</p>
<p>If this is how you feel, it’s important to tell someone you trust, whether that be a family member, friend, or even a coworker.</p>
<p>Although speaking about your feelings can feel intimidating, it’s important to remember that almost everyone experiences loneliness at some point during their lives. Indeed, a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/more-one-three-britons-feel-lonely-rising-more-half-those-aged-18-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> found that one in three Britons regularly feel lonely.</p>
<p>Speaking to people you care about and understanding that you are not alone in your feelings can help you connect with your loved ones.</p>
<p><em>3. Try not to compare yourself with others</em></p>
<p>As technology has developed over recent years, many of us have changed the way we communicate.</p>
<p>Being able to interact with people online can be a positive thing, as it allows you to speak to loved ones wherever they are and connect with people with similar interests.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to remember that what we see on social media is often carefully curated to make other people’s lives look better than they are.</p>
<p>Constantly seeing photos or videos of your friends and family socialising with others can make you feel like you’re the only person who feels lonely when that is simply not true.</p>
<p>Reminding yourself that social media does not reflect real life and remembering to occasionally disconnect so you can meet up with people in person can help you combat feelings of loneliness.</p>
<p><em>4. Connect with your community</em></p>
<p>However, technology can also be a fantastic way to help you build up the courage to speak to new people.</p>
<p>If you’ve felt lonely for a long time, the idea of talking to strangers may seem overwhelming. Starting slow and building yourself up to making new friends can help you to make deep connections with the people around you.</p>
<p>An easy way to start interacting with people is to consider your hobbies and join online communities dedicated to the same interests. Once you are more comfortable speaking to people about your favourite topics, you can look for local groups focused on the same things.</p>
<p>Another method to fight loneliness is to start having short conversations with people you come across in your day-to-day life. This could include your neighbours, people in public spaces, or even the cashier at your local shop.</p>
<p><em>5. Speak to a therapist</em></p>
<p>Talking to a therapist could help you explore the cause of your loneliness and come up with personalised plans to build connections with the people around you.</p>
<p>Therapists can help you to develop strategies for dealing with situations you find difficult – for example, helping you overcome anxiety around social interactions – so you can understand how your beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and behaviour.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who you choose to act on your behalf if you lose mental capacity is an important decision. You want to select someone you trust and you feel confident could act in your best interest should you need them to. So, read on to discover five practical questions you might want to answer when you’re setting up a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).</p>
<p>An LPA gives someone you trust the ability to make decisions on your behalf if you’re no longer able to. For example, they could take on this role if you’ve been involved in an accident or suffer from an illness that means you don’t have the mental capacity to handle your affairs.</p>
<p>There are two types of LPA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health and welfare LPA, which would cover decisions like your medical care, whether to continue life-sustaining treatment, moving into a care home, and your daily routine</li>
<li>Property and financial affairs LPA, which would cover decisions like paying your bills, managing your bank account or other assets, and selling your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should consider naming both types of LPA. They could provide you with security and ensure someone is acting on your behalf if you’re in a vulnerable position.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/your-industry/2024/04/02/number-of-lasting-power-of-attorneys-registered-exceeds-1mn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FTAdviser</em></a>, the number of LPAs registered in the last quarter of 2023 jumped by 37% when compared to a year earlier and marked the first time registrations exceeded a million.</p>
<p>Yet, a separate study from <a href="https://www.justgroupplc.co.uk/~/media/Files/J/Just-Retirement-Corp/news-doc/2023/3-4-million-over-75s-yet-to-arrange-a-power-of-attorney.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Group</a> also suggests that millions of families could be unable to act on behalf of their loved ones if something happened to them. Indeed, it’s estimated that 59% of over-75s haven’t arranged an LPA – the equivalent of 3.4 million people.</p>
<p>If you don’t have an LPA set up, someone wishing to act on your behalf may need to apply to the Court of Protection to be appointed as your “deputy”. This could mean someone you wouldn’t choose is given the responsibility of handling your affairs.</p>
<p>In addition, going through the Court of Protection can be a costly and lengthy process. It might place unnecessary stress on your loved ones at an already difficult time and could mean your affairs are left unattended for months. For instance, it may mean that you don’t have the support you need at home, such as care services, or that bills go unpaid.</p>
<p><strong>What to consider when choosing your Lasting Power of Attorney</strong></p>
<p>Your LPA must be someone who is aged 18 or older. Often, people choose family members as their LPA, but you might also select a trusted friend or even a professional, such as a solicitor, to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>These five practical questions could help you decide who to name as your LPA.</p>
<p><em>1. How many Lasting Powers of Attorney will you name?</em></p>
<p>You can select just one LPA, but you can also choose several people to act on your behalf. Multiple LPAs can be useful and help relieve some of the pressure they might feel if they need to make decisions for you. For example, if you have two children, you might choose to name them both so they can share the responsibility.</p>
<p>Even if you choose a single LPA, you may also want to name a replacement in case your first choice cannot fulfil their role.</p>
<p><em>2. Who do you trust to act on your behalf?</em></p>
<p>One of the first questions you’ll often want to consider is who you trust to make decisions on your behalf. An attorney will potentially have a lot of power over your life and financial affairs. So, it’s important you feel comfortable giving them this responsibility and are confident they’ll act in your best interests.</p>
<p>If you have multiple LPAs, it might be important to consider how well they’ll work together. Conflicts arising could harm your wellbeing and mean decisions are delayed.</p>
<p><em>3. Who has the right skills to act as a Lasting Power of Attorney? </em></p>
<p>Next, you may want to think about whether the people you’d choose as an LPA have the right skills for the role. You might want to consider how they handle their affairs – are they generally organised and make decisions that you agree with?</p>
<p><em>4. Would your Lasting Power of Attorney be comfortable making large decisions on your behalf? </em></p>
<p>Becoming an LPA can be a lot of responsibility, which some people might not be comfortable with.</p>
<p>Having a conversation with the person or people you’d prefer to act on your behalf can be valuable. It could provide an opportunity to talk about what your wishes would be, such as your views on life-sustaining treatment, and ensure they’d be confident making potentially difficult decisions for you.</p>
<p><em>5. Will your attorneys be able to make decisions independently? </em></p>
<p>Finally, if you’ll be naming more than one LPA, you’ll need to decide if they can make decisions independently or must act together.</p>
<p>Your LPA will state whether they must make decisions “jointly”, meaning all attorneys must agree, or “jointly and severally”, which means they could act independently. Being able to act severally might be useful if decisions need to be made urgently, such as those relating to medical treatment.</p>
<p>You can specify which decisions you’d like them to make together. For example, you might state they can handle tasks like managing your bills severally, but when it comes to selling property, they must make it jointly.</p>
<p><strong>Contact us to make a Lasting Power of Attorney part of your estate plan</strong></p>
<p>Naming an LPA can form part of your wider estate plan that considers how to manage your wealth later in life and when you pass away. If you’d like help creating an estate plan, please contact us.</p>
<p>As your financial planner, we may also understand your goals and what you’d like your LPA to consider when making financial decisions for you. We could offer support and guidance if they need to act on your behalf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Effectively managing your finances to get the most out of your assets often means going beyond paying into a pension regularly or selecting a fund to invest through. That’s why lifestyle financial planning could help you better align your finances with the life you want to lead now and in the future.</p>
<p>Financial advice alone might help you understand the benefits of investing money and which opportunities may suit your financial risk profile. While this is useful, it doesn’t consider how investing could support your lifestyle goals. Lifestyle financial planning could help you bridge the gap between your finances and aspirations.</p>
<p>Read on to find out more.</p>
<p><strong>A lifestyle financial planning conversation starts with your goals</strong></p>
<p>While you might expect a financial plan to start delving into the numbers straightaway, lifestyle financial planning is as much about your goals as your assets.</p>
<p>So, often conversations will start with what you aspire to in the short and long term. This approach means you can start to understand why you’ve set money goals. While you might have a target for your savings, what you want to do with the money is often what drives you to diligently add to the account every month.</p>
<p>For example, when building a nest egg, you might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning to use it to retire early</li>
<li>Improving your financial security by creating a safety net</li>
<li>Dreaming about a once-in-a-lifetime cruise you want to take</li>
<li>Putting money aside to help your children or grandchildren get on the property ladder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only could your goals give your financial plan a direction, but it may provide useful motivation too.</p>
<p>Putting money aside for a retirement that is still a decade away might feel tedious, especially if there are experiences you’d like now. Yet, if you’re looking forward to a retirement that allows you to travel more or indulge in hobbies, you might be less likely to cut your contributions.</p>
<p>Having a clear idea about what you’re working towards may mean you find it easier to make sacrifices now. Yet, according to an <a href="https://www.aegon.co.uk/content/dam/auk/assets/publication/marketing-support/financial-wellbeing-index-summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aegon</a> report, just 1 in 4 people have a concrete vision of the things and experiences their future self might want.</p>
<p>So, as part of creating a lifestyle financial plan, you might want to dedicate some time to thinking about what your goals are.</p>
<p>In addition to goals, you may also want to consider what you’re worried about. For example, when you consider your future, you might be concerned about how:</p>
<ul>
<li>To pay for care costs if needed</li>
<li>Inflation might affect your retirement income</li>
<li>Your partner would cope financially if you passed away first</li>
<li>To pass on your wealth tax-efficiently during your lifetime or when you pass away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking about your worries as part of your financial plan might help you identify ways to put your mind at ease. For instance, if you’re worried about how the cost of care could affect your wealth and loved ones, you may decide to set money aside to cover a potential bill.</p>
<p><strong>Your lifestyle goals are at the centre of your financial plan</strong></p>
<p>Once your priorities are set out, it’s time to start thinking about the numbers – are your goals realistic and what steps might you need to take to reach them?</p>
<p>Starting with your goals means you can focus on how to use your wealth to live the life you want rather than simply looking at how to grow your assets.</p>
<p>Take retirement, for example. You might calculate that if you work until you’re 65, you can use your pension to create an income of £45,000 a year. But, if retiring early is what you really want, and you can retire at 55 with a lower, but still comfortable income, you might decide that building more pension wealth isn’t the right option for you.</p>
<p>Lifestyle financial planning could help put your wealth into perspective and allow you to see how it might be used to turn aspirations into reality.</p>
<p><strong>Regular reviews could help ensure your lifestyle financial plan continues to align with your goals</strong></p>
<p>During your lifetime, you’re likely to encounter obstacles, be presented with opportunities, or simply change your mind.</p>
<p>Your lifestyle financial plan isn’t static; it can evolve to suit your needs. Regular meetings are a vital part of ensuring your finances continue to reflect both your circumstances and aspirations.</p>
<p>For instance, seeing your grandchildren struggle to get on the property ladder might mean you’re keen to pass on wealth during your lifetime. If you’d previously planned to pass on wealth through an inheritance, you may benefit from reviewing how gifting could affect your wealth now and in the long term.</p>
<p>Knowing that you have someone to discuss your changing wishes with could give you the confidence to pursue new goals.</p>
<p>In the above example, calculating if you’d still have a financially comfortable retirement after providing grandchildren with a property deposit could offer you peace of mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The study of how psychology affects financial behaviours is fascinating. Understanding the basics could improve your relationship with money and how it influences your financial decisions.</p>
<p>Behavioural finance looks at how psychological influences and biases affect the behaviour of investors. It aims to understand why people make certain financial choices and the effect it could have on returns.</p>
<p>The study argues that investors don’t always behave rationally or have self-control. Instead, your mental state and biases play a role in your decision-making.</p>
<p>As well as the effect it has on an individual’s wealth, behavioural finance notes that it could explain market anomalies, such as a sharp rise or fall in the value of a particular stock or even an index.</p>
<p>For example, one behavioural financial concept is the “emotional gap”.</p>
<p>The emotional gap refers to decisions based on extreme emotions. You might read a headline about how a company’s value is going to “plummet” in the newspaper. If you hold stocks with that company, it’s normal to fear or worry about what that could mean for your finances. These emotions might prompt you to sell the stock to avoid the perceived potential losses, even if that decision doesn’t align with your long-term financial plan.</p>
<p>If a large group of people read the same headline and also experienced fear, it could lead to the price of that company’s stock falling, even if its intrinsic value hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>So, how could improving your understanding of behavioural finance help you?</p>
<p><strong>Awareness of behavioural finance may help you keep your emotions in check</strong></p>
<p>It’s normal for your experiences to affect your emotions and decisions. Yet, when you’re investing, it could lead to you making decisions that don’t align with your goals and potentially harm your long-term plans.</p>
<p>Deciding to withdraw investments because you’re worried the value will fall might lead to lost returns when you look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>It’s not just negative emotions that could influence your investment decisions either. You might also feel excited about an investment opportunity after you’ve read about it in the newspaper, so you proceed without fully assessing the risks or if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2023/05/30/emotion-driven-decisions-costing-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FTAdviser</em></a> report, 61% of investors who take financial advice worry about short-term market movements. A similar proportion also regularly made decisions or proposals based on these concerns that “surprised” their adviser.</p>
<p>Being aware of financial bias could mean you’re able to keep your emotions in check.</p>
<p><strong>Recognising bias could put you in a better position to evaluate information </strong></p>
<p>Emotions are an important part of behavioural finance, and so is understanding how you evaluate information.</p>
<p>For example, anchoring is a type of bias where your view is anchored to a particular piece of data. You might hold on to this information, even if it becomes irrelevant or separate data offers a different view.</p>
<p>Let’s say you first see a stock listed for £50. You might become fixated on this price regardless of other factors that may affect its value when you’re deciding how to manage the investment.</p>
<p>Once again, these types of bias could lead to decisions that aren’t right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding investor behaviour could help you feel more confident about market movements </strong></p>
<p>As an investor, it can be challenging to keep your nerves in check when the market is experiencing volatility. Understanding what might be driving this could help to put your mind at ease.</p>
<p>The market moving up and down is part of investing. Numerous factors affect the value of the market and short-term movements are normal. Yet, when you see values fall, it can still be nerve-wracking. It can make it tempting to try and time the market to minimise losses.</p>
<p>However, as investors, and as a result the market, can act irrationally, timing the market consistently is impossible. Rather than reducing potential losses, it could mean you miss out on returns overall. Recognising this may help you feel more confident during periods of volatility so you’re more likely to stick to your long-term investment strategy.</p>
<p>Historical data shows that, despite short-term movements, the long-term trend of markets is an upward one. Even after periods of recession or downturns, the market has recovered when you look at returns over years rather than days or months.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that investment returns cannot be guaranteed and there is a risk. However, for most investors, taking a long-term approach makes financial sense.</p>
<p><strong>Working with a financial planner could reduce the effect of emotions and bias</strong></p>
<p>Recognising when your emotions or biases are influencing your financial decisions can be difficult. Working with a financial planner means you have someone to turn to when creating your financial plan if you’re thinking about making changes. With the benefit of a different perspective, you can identify when you might be responding to emotions or bias in a way that might harm your long-term goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you take a proactive approach to managing your wealth, you could reduce how much Inheritance Tax (IHT) your estate may be liable for when you pass away.</p>
<p>Last month, you read about what IHT is and when estates become liable to pay it. Now, read on to discover some of the shrewd strategies you could use to reduce a potential IHT bill.</p>
<p><strong>Around 1 in 22 estates are liable for Inheritance Tax</strong></p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/inheritance-tax-liabilities-statistics/inheritance-tax-liabilities-statistics-commentary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HMRC</a> figures show that around 1 in 22 estates are liable for IHT. In fact, in 2021/22, 4.39% of deaths resulted in an IHT charge. However, frozen IHT thresholds mean the portion of estates liable for IHT is slowly rising.</p>
<p>While only a small proportion of estates face an IHT bill, the standard IHT rate of 40% means it can lead to a sizeable amount going to HMRC rather than your beneficiaries. Indeed, according to the <a href="https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/tax-by-tax-spend-by-spend/inheritance-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>, HMRC collected £7.1 billion through IHT in 2022/23. The organisation expects the figure to reach £9.7 billion in 2028/29.</p>
<p>So, if your estate could exceed the nil-rate band, which is £325,000 in 2024/25, you might want to consider these steps to reduce a potential IHT bill.</p>
<p><em>1. Write or review your will</em></p>
<p>A will is one of the key steps you can take to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes. Your will can also be used to manage IHT liability by distributing your assets in a way that allows you to use allowances.</p>
<p>For example, the residence nil-rate band could increase how much you’re able to pass on tax-efficiently if you leave your main home to children or grandchildren. In 2024/25, the residence nil-rate band is £175,000, so it could significantly boost the amount you’re able to pass on before your estate needs to pay IHT.</p>
<p>Yet, according to a <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/property/2024/01/05/more-than-half-of-brits-do-not-have-a-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FTAdviser</em></a> report, a third of adults aged 55 or over have not made a will.</p>
<p>If you already have a will in place, reviewing it may be worthwhile. You might find opportunities to reduce your estate’s IHT liability or that your wishes have changed.</p>
<p>It’s often a good idea to check your will every five years or following major life events, such as getting married, welcoming children, or relationships breaking down.</p>
<p><em>2. Gift assets during your lifetime</em></p>
<p>Giving away some of your wealth during your lifetime might bring the value of your estate under IHT thresholds or reduce the overall bill. It could also be useful for your loved ones, who may benefit more from financial support now compared to later in life.</p>
<p>Some gifts may be considered immediately outside of your estate for IHT purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to £3,000 in 2024/25 known as the “annual exemption”</li>
<li>Small gifts of up to £250 to each person, so long as they have not benefited from another allowance</li>
<li>Wedding gifts of up to £1,000, rising to £2,500 for your grandchildren or great-grandchildren and £5,000 for your child</li>
<li>Regular gifts that you make from your income that do not affect your ability to meet your usual living costs. For example, you might pay rent for your child or contribute to the savings account of your grandchild. It’s important these gifts are regular and it’s often a good idea to keep a record of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, other gifts may be known as a “potentially exempt transfer” (PET) and could be included in IHT calculations for up to seven years after they were received.</p>
<p>You might also need to consider how gifting could affect your long-term financial security.</p>
<p>If you want to gift assets to your loved ones during your lifetime, making it part of your financial plan could offer peace of mind. We may be able to help you understand how gifting will affect your wealth in the future and how to do so tax-efficiently.</p>
<p><em>3. Use your pension to pass on wealth</em></p>
<p>For IHT purposes, your pension usually sits outside your estate. As a result, it might provide a valuable way to pass on assets. According to a <a href="https://www.pensionbee.com/uk/press/pensions-and-inheritance-tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PensionBee</a> survey, almost two-thirds of Brits were unaware of this, so your pension might be an option you’ve overlooked when considering IHT.</p>
<p>Choosing to use other assets to fund your retirement could help you pass on more to your loved ones through your pension. Considering your beneficiaries when you’re creating a retirement plan could help you decide which option is right for your goals.</p>
<p>While pensions aren’t normally liable for IHT, your beneficiary may need to consider Income Tax when accessing funds held in an inherited pension in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Your pension isn’t typically covered by your will. Instead, you can complete an expression of wish form to inform your pension provider who you’d like to receive it when you pass away.</p>
<p><em>4. Place assets in a trust</em></p>
<p>Provided certain conditions are met, assets that are placed in trust no longer belong to you. So, they normally won’t be included when calculating an IHT bill.</p>
<p>A trust is a legal arrangement that holds assets for the benefit of another person. As the benefactor, you can set out who will benefit from the assets and under what circumstances, which can give you greater control when compared to gifting or leaving an inheritance. In some cases, you may still benefit from the assets held in a trust, such as receiving the dividends from investments.</p>
<p>You can also name a trustee, who would be responsible for managing the trust in line with your wishes and for the benefit of the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>There are several different types of trusts and it’s important it’s set up correctly to ensure it meets your needs, including reducing a potential IHT bill if that’s one of your priorities. Taking legal advice might be valuable when creating a trust.</p>
<p>In addition, it may be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to reverse decisions related to a trust. As a result, you should think carefully about which assets you place in a trust and how your decisions align with your wider financial plan. Please arrange a meeting with us if you’d like to talk about putting some of your wealth into a trust.</p>
<p><em>5. Take out life insurance </em></p>
<p>Life insurance isn’t a way to reduce your estate’s IHT liability. However, it could provide a useful way for your family to pay the bill.</p>
<p>Whole of life insurance cover would pay out a lump sum to your beneficiaries when you pass away. They could then use this payout to cover the IHT bill, so they wouldn’t need to consider how to use their inheritance to pay the cost. This option might ease the stress your loved ones are dealing with at a time when they’re grieving or handling your affairs.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that you’ll need to pay regular premiums to maintain life insurance coverage. The cost of life insurance can vary depending on a range of factors, from the size of the eventual payout to your health.</p>
<p>You might want to consider using a trust to hold the life insurance. Otherwise, the payout could be added to the value of your estate and increase the IHT that is due.</p>
<p>Legal advice may be useful when setting up a trust, which can be complex.</p>

<p>There might be other ways you could reduce a potential IHT bill too. If you have any questions about IHT or your wider financial plan, please contact us.</p>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs’ practice and the law relating to taxation are complex and subject to individual circumstances and changes which cannot be foreseen.</p>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority does not regulate estate planning, trusts or Inheritance Tax planning.</p>
<p>Note that life insurance plans typically have no cash in value at any time and cover will cease at the end of the term. If premiums stop, then cover will lapse.</p>
<p>Will writing is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The Openwork Partnership accepts no responsibility for this aspect of our business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeowners worried they could face a financial shortfall in retirement are already considering using their property wealth to fund their plans. While equity release could provide a capital injection to reach retirement goals, it’s important to weigh up the pros and cons first.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by the <a href="https://www.equityreleasecouncil.com/news/no-brick-left-unturned-three-in-five-uk-homeowners-look-to-property-wealth-to-prop-up-retirement-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity Release Council</a> (ERC), 3 in 5 homeowners are interested in releasing money from their property later in life. Indeed, only 26% of homeowners rule out the possibility of accessing some of the money that’s tied up in their homes in the future.</p>
<p>Given that many workers feel pessimistic about their retirement and the amount they’re saving, it’s perhaps not surprising that they’re considering how they might use their property.</p>
<p>PensionBee’s <a href="https://www.pensionbee.com/uk/pension-confidence-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pension Confidence Index</a> found that only 54% of those aged between 55 and 64 felt positive about their pension. The most common reason for negative sentiments is wishing they’d saved more for retirement. Younger generations feel equally gloomy about their retirement prospects.</p>
<p>So, if you’re worried about your financial security once you stop working, considering how to use property, which is often among your largest assets, can be attractive.</p>
<p><strong>Equity release could provide you with a lump sum to fund retirement</strong></p>
<p>The most common type of equity release is known as a “lifetime mortgage”. You’ll usually need to be aged 55 to be eligible for a lifetime mortgage.</p>
<p>A lifetime mortgage is essentially a loan that’s secured against your home. However, unlike traditional loans, it usually isn’t paid back until you die or move into long-term care. As a result, it could boost your retirement income without expenses rising.</p>
<p>You can choose to receive the money released from your property as a lump sum or through drawdown, which would allow you to access more as and when you need to.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.equityreleasecouncil.com/news/q1-2024-equity-release-market-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERC</a>, in the first quarter of 2024, new drawdown customers agreed on an average loan of almost £115,000 and took just over £59,500 upfront. The average customer accessing property wealth as a lump sum received almost £103,500.</p>
<p>The amount you could receive through equity release would depend on the value of your property and your circumstances. Typically, you can access between 20% and 60% of the property’s market value. So, a lifetime mortgage has the potential to provide a sizeable income boost that could make your retirement more comfortable.</p>
<p>However, as you usually don’t make payments on a lifetime mortgage, the amount you owe can rapidly increase.</p>
<p><strong>The compounding effect could mean the debt rises quickly</strong></p>
<p>A key drawback to using a lifetime mortgage is that the outstanding debt can rise rapidly due to the effects of compounding.</p>
<p>The interest on a lifetime mortgage is usually rolled up, as you don’t have to make regular repayments, you end up paying interest on the original sum you borrowed and the interest that has already been accrued.</p>
<p>Calculations from <a href="https://www.standardlife.co.uk/equity-release/compound-interest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Life</a> highlight how this could affect the amount you owe.</p>
<p>Let’s say you borrow £81,703 with an interest rate of 6.74%. In the first year, £5,681 would be added to the amount you owe. Assuming you didn’t make any repayments, in the second year, the amount of interest added would rise to £6,075.</p>
<p>Over a long time frame, this compounding effect can really add up. Indeed, in the above scenario, after 15 years, the interest added would rise to £14,555 and your outstanding balance would be £233,915 – over £142,000 more than you initially borrowed.</p>
<p>So, equity release could have a huge effect on the value of your estate and what you leave behind for loved ones.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that many lifetime mortgages will allow you to make interest payments without paying a fee. As a result, you could reduce how much the outstanding balance grows, but you’ll need to consider how it might affect your budget in retirement.</p>
<p>There are other drawbacks to consider if you’re thinking about using equity release too, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may need to pay an early repayment charge if you choose to repay all or part of the loan early.</li>
<li>If you’re entitled to means-tested benefits, receiving capital through a lifetime mortgage could mean you’re no longer eligible.</li>
<li>You usually won’t be able to take out another loan against your home, so your options could be limited if you want to borrow more.</li>
<li>A lifetime mortgage might make it more difficult to move home, so you may want to consider whether your property will suit your needs over the long term.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to weigh up these potential disadvantages before taking out a lifetime mortgage to ensure it’s the right decision for you.</p>

<p>A lifetime mortgage is not suitable for everyone and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits, so it is important to seek financial advice before taking any action. If you are considering releasing equity from your home, you should consider all options available before equity release.</p>
<p>The interest that may be accrued over the long term with a lifetime mortgage, may mean it is not the cheapest solution. As interest is charged on both the original loan and the interest that has been added, the amount you owe will increase over time, reducing the equity left in your home and the value of any inheritance, potentially to nothing.</p>
<p>Although the final decision is yours, you are encouraged to discuss your plans with your family and beneficiaries, as a lifetime mortgage could have an impact on any potential inheritance. We would also encourage you to invite them to join any meetings with your financial adviser so they can ask questions and join in the decision, as we believe it is better to discuss your decision with them before you go ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a common misconception that financial protection doesn’t pay out when you need to make a claim. This belief might put you off using it to create a valuable safety net. Read on to discover some key figures that prove it could be a useful addition to your financial plan.</p>
<p>Financial protection is a term used to cover several different types of insurance that would pay out under certain circumstances, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Life insurance, which would provide your beneficiaries with a lump sum if you passed away during the term</li>
<li>Income protection, which would pay you a regular income if you were too ill or injured to work until you could return to work, retire, or the term ends</li>
<li>Critical illness, which would pay out a lump sum to you if you were diagnosed with a covered illness.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, financial protection could provide you or your loved ones with an essential cash injection when the unexpected happens. The payout may be used how the recipient wishes, from clearing large financial commitments, such as a mortgage, to covering day-to-day expenses.</p>
<p>As a result, you could use financial protection to create a safety net for your family.</p>
<p>If you’ve put off taking out financial protection in the past because you believe you wouldn’t receive a payout if you needed to make a claim, here are five interesting figures that may change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>1. 9% of life insurance claims were paid in 2022 </strong></p>
<p>According to statistics collected by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/life-insurance/life-insurance-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Forbes</em></a>, the vast majority of life insurance claims result in a payout. In 2022, 96.9% of claims were approved.</p>
<p>However, the figures also suggest that just 35% of people have taken out life insurance. So, many families could find they’d be financially vulnerable if there were an unexpected death. It can be difficult to think about how your family would cope if you passed away, but assessing their financial resilience now could potentially help you take steps to ensure their long-term security.</p>
<p>One of the most common reasons life insurance claims are rejected is non-disclosure. It’s important to be honest and clear when you’re taking out any type of financial protection – not providing details about pre-diagnosed conditions or your lifestyle could mean a future claim isn’t upheld.</p>
<p><strong>2. The average life insurance payout in 2022 was more than £73,500</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Forbes</em> data also found that the average amount paid out as a result of a life insurance claim was more than £73,500.</p>
<p>When taking out life insurance, you can choose how much the potential payout will be to suit the needs of your family.</p>
<p>You may choose to link the potential payout to financial commitments. For example, you might want to ensure it’ll provide your loved ones with a way to pay off the mortgage. Or you might want to calculate how it could be used to cover regular expenses to provide stability for your children until they reach adulthood.</p>
<p>If your loved ones might struggle to manage a lump sum, you could also consider family income benefit. Again, your family could claim if you passed away during the term. However, rather than a lump sum, it would provide a regular income to your loved ones for a defined period.</p>
<p><strong>3. The number of people making an income protection claim increased by 9% in 2022</strong></p>
<p>When asked why they haven’t taken out income protection, many people believe that an unexpected event that leaves them unable to work would never happen to them. Yet, it’s impossible to know what’s around the corner.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the <a href="https://www.abi.org.uk/news/news-articles/2023/5/protection-insurers-pay-out-6.85-billion-to-support-individuals-and-families/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association of British Insurers</a> (ABI), more than 15,900 people made an income protection claim in 2022 – a 9% increase when compared to a year earlier. Of course, the number of people who were affected by an accident or illness but did not have income protection is likely to be much higher.</p>
<p>In total, more than £231 million was paid out to people who were unable to work. The most common claim was for musculoskeletal issues, such as neck and back pain.</p>
<p><strong>4. 9 in 10 people making a critical illness claim were successful</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, the ABI statistics show more than 9 in 10 claims made by holders of critical illness cover received a payout in 2022, with the average person receiving around £66,000.</p>
<p>A critical illness may mean you need to take an extended period off work to recover your health, and a payout could help cover your essential expenses. In some cases, being diagnosed with a critical illness could also affect your lifestyle and the payout could be useful if you need to adapt your home or pay for specialist care.</p>
<p><strong>5. Protection collectively paid more than £6.85 billion to individuals and families in 2022</strong></p>
<p>Finally, proving that financial protection does pay out in many cases, collectively those claiming in 2022 received £6.85 billion. Benefiting from a portion of this money may have helped claimants continue with their lives when the unexpected happens, provide for their families, or allow them to take some time away from work to recover.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
<p>This blog is for general information only and does not constitute advice. The information is aimed at retail clients only.</p>
<p>Note that financial protection plans typically have no cash in value at any time and cover will cease at the end of the term. If premiums stop, then cover will lapse.</p>
<p>Cover is subject to terms and conditions and may have exclusions. Definitions of illnesses vary from product provider and will be explained within the policy documentation.</p>
